# NO LONGER USED

This "project" was used by around 160 people during the 2020-2021 Fall semester. Due to the hacky and frankly way-too-opiniated nature of it, it is now obsolete. There are much more productive things to do than to try and keep this around.

*Looking back at it, the initial difficulty must've been mostly due to how much I had to hack around existing things rather than simply using the extension API...*
